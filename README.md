Development

1. use node v16
2. install dependencies
3. clone the [contracts repo](http://github.com/fweb3/contracts) and follow instructions
4. run in development mode `npm run dev`

Notes:
Many folks are using yarn these days. While yarn used to be much faster than npm and was preferred. npm has improved drastically and now is much faster and smarter than yarn IMO. Please use npm if you're gonna install packages.
